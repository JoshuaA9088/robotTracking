## Robot Tracking

Using OpenCV2 and Numpy to track a scribbler 2 robot. Specifically been used and tested with the Kaicong SIP 1602 Camera (Hopefully will be updating to use raspberry pi camera V2).
The ultimate objective of this script is to be able to click somewhere within a window and have the robot move to that location based on alternate color space tracking.

Depending on whether you would like to run with or without the robot click below.
