## Robot Tracking

Using OpenCV2 and Numpy to track a scribbler 2 robot. Specifically been used and tested with the Kaicong SIP 1602 Camera and the Raspberry Pi Camera.
The ultimate objective of this script is to be able to click somewhere within a window and have the robot move to that location based on alternate color space tracking.
