## Installing Myro and other prerequisites

Myro is very old and not well maintained. I forked myro to try and keep it alive. I have ported the majority of it to Python 3 excluding the built-in camera modules. The link to the new repository is [here](https://github.com/jarulsamy/myro). It should also be cross-platform compatible now.

## Installation

Ensure you are using **Python 3.6+**.
Myro should now be in the PyPi repositories, so it can be installed with pip.

    pip install myro
